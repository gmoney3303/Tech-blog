## description
This project helped me learn a lot more about everything. overall file structuring was used more in this project sometimes making it confusing but also helpfull.
mainly I learned more about get and post routes for new information in databases then displaying that information using handlebars which was also confusing at first

## credits 
I got a lot of help in office hours from my teachers on this project and a tutoring session with Chris B.
I also used chatgpt to debugg a lot of my code
